## About

Hey there! I'm a current senior studying Computer Science at UCLA, with a minor in Film, TV, and Digital Media. I love exploring new and exciting fields and ways I can use computer science to tackle problems in those fields. In particular, I'm fascinated in the many intersections between the arts and computer science. I learn best by doing, so I'm always looking for new projects to work on and new people to collaborate with. My focus is on computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and software engineering, but I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities.

I'm looking for full-time opportunities starting in June 2025. If you think I'd be a good fit for your team, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ugathoo/)!

I'm currently a member of UCLA's Varsity Mock Trial team. We travel around the country to compete in the highest levels of collegiate mock trial. I've been a member of the team since my freshman year, and had the opportunity to work with some of the best attorneys and coaches in the country. I've learned a lot about public speaking, logical reasoning, adapting to real-time changes to the plan, and how to advocate for myself and others.

I was previously:
* An **Technical Intern** at **Cisco Systems** for **Summer 2023**.
    * Worked on the DevOps team, developing a new CLI for the internal company use.
    * Developed a new CI/CD pipeline for the CLI, using Jenkins and AWS Kubernetes cluster data.
* A **Comms-Enterprise Product Marketing Intern** at **SiTime Corp** for **Summer 2022**.
    * Automated data analysis, cleaning, and report generation off of Salesforce and internal databases using a network of Python scripts.
    * Wrote documentation to explain how to use the scripts, the types of reports they generated, and how to update the scripts if needed.

I have experience with and/or working knowledge of **Python**, **C**/**C++**, **Java**, **Groovy**, **Golang**, and more. I also pick up new languages extremely quickly, so no matter your project's needs, I'm sure I can help out.
